# JetsProject

## Description
Application has multiple options for the user to manipulate a list of jets. On start up, a list is generated from a file, the default list is 
made of 5 jets, but can loaded with any number about of jets, including zero. Once the fleet has been generated, the user will be able
continuously use a menu option which allows them to either; list the fleet, fly all jets, load all cargo jets, fight all fighter jets 
add more jets to the air field, remove air jets from the air field, determine the fastest and longest range of jets. The menu is printed
until the user is done with the program and leaves the system.

## Technology Used
Jave, file I/O, Interfaces

## Lessons Learned
This was a huge learning process and really taught what restrictions you have on abstract classes and their children. My level of knowledge
on working with classes and interfaces really grew from this project. It did take a lot of time and I wanted to try some mroe stretch goals.
I did experiment with try and catch's on most of the times a user needed to provide input. I was only able to incorporate it in the 
remove jets and the menu option. The add jets had a lot of places where a user could cause an error.
